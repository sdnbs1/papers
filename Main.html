            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                The application of faster-than-light (FTL) travel is no longer hypothetical. Groundbreaking advancements in multidimensional physics and Higgs field engineering have realized technologies enabling interstellar exploration. This paper consolidates key foundational studies, led by prominent scientists, that underpin the realization of transrelativity technology. Topics include probability constants in Yukawa interactions, quantum fluctuations in Higgs fields, the practical applications of transrelativity, and the physiological challenges posed by high-G accelerations.

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Interstellar exploration has long been constrained by the relativistic limit of light-speed travel. Transrelativity theory redefines these limits by leveraging multidimensional physics, Higgs field modulation, and probabilistic navigation through higher dimensions. The foundation for this breakthrough rests on key research conducted by eminent scientists, detailed in a series of seminal papers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This paper integrates findings from these studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of transrelativity and its applications.
